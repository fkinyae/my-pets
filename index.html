    <h2><strong>Domestic Cat.</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>COMMON NAME:</strong>Domestic Cat</li>
        <li><strong>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong><em>Felis catus</em></li>
        <li><strong>TYPE:</strong>Mammals</li>
        <li><strong>DIET:</strong>Carnivore</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><strong>Relationship With Humans.</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <em>Felis catus</em> has had a very long relationship with humans. Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate attention of humans. Early Egyptians worshipped a cat goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next worldâ€”accompanied by mummified mice! Cultures around the world later adopted cats as their own companions.

    <h3><strong>Hunting Abilities</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Like their wild relatives, domestic cats are natural hunters able to stalk prey and pounce with sharp claws and teeth. They are particularly effective at night, when their light-reflecting eyes allow them to see better than much of their prey. Cats also enjoy acute hearing. All cats are nimble and agile, and their long tails aid their outstanding balance.

    <h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Cats communicate by marking trees, fence posts, or furniture with their claws or their waste. These scent posts are meant to inform others of a cat's home range. House cats employ a vocal repertoire that extends from a purr to a screech.
